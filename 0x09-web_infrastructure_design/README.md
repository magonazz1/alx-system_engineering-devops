# Project 0x09: Web Infrastructure Design

## Overview

Welcome to Project 0x09: Web Infrastructure Design, a collaborative effort to delve into the intricate aspects of web infrastructure, DevOps, and SysAdmin. This project, led by Sylvain Kalache, co-founder at Holberton School, spans various critical concepts in the realm of web development and server management. The primary goal is to design a robust web stack, ensuring scalability, security, and effective monitoring.

## Concepts Explored

The project explores key concepts, including but not limited to:

- DNS (Domain Name System)
- Monitoring
- Web Server
- Network Basics
- Load Balancer
- Server

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion, participants are expected to:

- Draw a comprehensive diagram of the web stack developed in the SysAdmin/DevOps track projects.
- Explain the functionality of each component within the web infrastructure.
- Articulate the concept of system redundancy.
- Demonstrate understanding of acronyms like LAMP, SPOF, and QPS.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Simple Web Stack

- Design a one-server web infrastructure with a LAMP stack.
- Explain the role of each component.
- Highlight issues like SPOF, downtime during maintenance, and scalability concerns.

**[Task 0 - Simple Web Stack](./0-simple_web_stack)**

### Task 1: Distributed Web Infrastructure

- Design a three-server web infrastructure for www.foobar.com.
- Introduce elements such as load balancer and discuss their necessity.
- Explain load balancer configurations, Active-Active vs. Active-Passive setups, and Primary-Replica clusters.
- Identify issues, including SPOF, security vulnerabilities, and lack of monitoring.

**[Task 1 - Distributed Web Infrastructure](./1-distributed_web_infrastructure)**

### Task 2: Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure

- Design a secured and monitored three-server web infrastructure for www.foobar.com.
- Integrate firewalls, SSL certificates, and monitoring clients.
- Provide rationale for each additional element.
- Address potential issues related to SSL termination, MySQL server capacity, and component homogeneity.

**[Task 2 - Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure](./2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure)**

### Task 3: Scale Up (Advanced)

- Explore the difference between application server and web server.
- Implement a scalable infrastructure with multiple servers, load balancers, and split components.
- Clearly articulate the reasons behind each addition.

**[Task 3 - Scale Up (Advanced)](./3-scale_up)**

## Conclusion

Project 0x09 presents a challenging yet rewarding exploration of web infrastructure design, encompassing essential concepts in DevOps and SysAdmin. Participants will gain hands-on experience in creating scalable, secure, and monitored web stacks, preparing them for real-world challenges in the field of web development and server management. Remember, each task completed brings you one step closer to mastering the intricacies of web infrastructure. Good luck and enjoy the journey!
