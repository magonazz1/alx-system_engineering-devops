# Project Title: 0x04 Loops, Conditions, and Parsing

## Overview

This project focuses on reinforcing your skills in working with loops, conditions, and parsing in Bash scripting. You will be applying these concepts to various tasks, ranging from simple loop displays to more advanced parsing of Apache logs.

## Expected Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, you are expected to:

- Create SSH key pairs and understand the fundamentals of SSH authentication.
- Master the usage of loops (for, while, until) and condition statements (if, else, elif, case) in Bash scripting.
- Gain proficiency in parsing and processing data using tools like `awk`.
- Improve your scripting skills and enhance your ability to write clean and efficient Bash scripts.
- Develop a deeper understanding of file operations and comparisons in a Unix-like environment.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Use allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- All scripts should be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- Ensure that all Bash script files are executable.
- Follow the specified file structure and naming conventions for tasks.
- Utilize `Shellcheck` to ensure your Bash scripts pass without errors.
- Adhere to the provided requirements for each task.

### Tasks

0. **Create a SSH RSA key pair**
   - Generate an RSA key pair and share the public key as specified.

1. **For Best School loop**
   - Write a Bash script using a `for` loop to display "Best School" 10 times.

2. **While Best School loop**
   - Write a Bash script using a `while` loop to display "Best School" 10 times.

3. **Until Best School loop**
   - Write a Bash script using an `until` loop to display "Best School" 10 times.

4. **If 9, say Hi!**
   - Write a Bash script to display "Best School" 10 times, with a special condition on the 9th iteration.

5. **4 bad luck, 8 is your chance**
   - Write a Bash script with a loop and conditional statements to display different messages based on the iteration.

6. **Superstitious numbers**
   - Write a Bash script using a `case` statement to display specific messages for certain loop iterations.

7. **Clock**
   - Write a Bash script to display time for 12 hours and 59 minutes using a `while` loop.

8. **For ls**
   - Write a Bash script using a `for` loop to list and format the content of the current directory.

9. **To file, or not to file**
    - Write a Bash script to check and provide information about the existence and properties of a file.

10. **FizzBuzz**
    - Write a Bash script to display numbers from 1 to 100 with specific conditions.

11. **Read and cut (Advanced)**
    - Write a Bash script to display selective information from the /etc/passwd file using a `while` loop.

12. **Tell the story of passwd (Advanced)**
    - Write a Bash script to create a narrative based on the content of /etc/passwd using a `while` loop and IFS.

13. **Let's parse Apache logs (Advanced)**
    - Write a Bash script to parse and display visitor IP along with HTTP status code from an Apache log file using `awk`.

14. **Dig the data (Advanced)**
    - Write a Bash script to group visitors by IP and HTTP status code, displaying the data in a sorted list using `awk`.

## Final Remarks

Congratulations on completing the advanced tasks of this project! Ensure that all your scripts are well-documented, follow best practices, and pass the necessary validations. Remember to commit your code along with the provided answers and any additional files required for the tasks.

**Have fun scripting and happy coding!**
